I ordered a fish special at market price and couldn't believe how yummy it was. Can't recall the name of the fish but it was in the grouper family. It tasted very identical to crab meat.   I had my one year old daughter with and couldn't get her to eat anything, but she loved my fish! Service was friendly.

I paid $500+ to reserve hair and makeup for my bridal party in September.   I was not informed that the business was closed and haven't received any responses regarding to getting a refund. Roya is a total scammer and a disgrace to the beauty industry.  I have a contract and proof regarding their refund policy for weddings, it says 50% of the total was due and a refund is eligible if given 14 days notice. Here I am giving almost 4 months notice.

This place is a girls ultimate nightmare if you want to somewhat keep your length. I tried to be reasonable and give it a few days to get used to it, however NOBODY should ever feel this way after getting their hair done. If you're looking for a professional ladies hair cut, go elsewhere. I'm now investing out of pocket to get extensions. By far the worst hair cut I've ever had in my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

I've eaten there a couple of times and so far like it. There no more expensive then other sushi bars so you'll know about what to expect when u get there. If u set at bar you'll get soup when u order sushi that's no charge kinda helps fill u up.

The popcorn is great however the food is not so good and kinda expensive. But worst of all is the service once you get your order it takes forever to get your server to come back for a refill on your drink or perhaps more catsup or even refill on your popcorn which is supposed to be all you can eat. Then there right on about getting your bill (of course) just about ruined the comfortable chairs and great sound system that for me anyway but YES I'll go back but we're not gonna eat there and thinking of bringing water bottles In my wife's purse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

The highlight of our stay was the morning breakfasts, and the staff.  Excellent customer service, friendly, and very efficient.  Our room was clean, and kept that way by the great housekeeping staff.  The heat and air conditioning worked flawlessly, and we really liked the amenities in our room.  The room was spacious, we used the fridge to store drinks, but found ourselves frequenting the complimentary soda during the evening hours, a very nice touch.  There is also a food kiosk available 7/24 at the front desk, another nice feature.  There was a big group of team volleyball players that kept the place hopping on Friday and Saturday.  The staff kept up, keeping things stocked and clean during the busy hours.  There was a bit of noise from all the kids, doors slamming, running in the halls, and general loud voices.  To be expected with the weekend crowds.  All was quiet after 10pm, thankfully.  Our TV worked great, we really liked the convenient outlets in the room.  Great for charging all of our electronics.  I know this hotel is on the lower end of the luxury spectrum, but we had a really good experience here.  One thing we felt could make the hallways quieter was some sound absorbing wall coverings, maybe some canvas pictures etc.  That was our only critique, and really it was a very small one.                                                                                                               |\n",

The admission was $31 for two adults, and worth the three hours we spent checking out all the cool displays.  I can't accurately convey all of the cool aviation history here, suffice to say it is vast.  If you go, don't miss the B17 hangar with all of the 570th Bombing Group memorabilia.  It is an incredible insight into the odds that were faced by the flight crews of these beautiful flying machines.  We have been to the Air and Space Museum in San Diego, as well as several other aviation displays and air shows.  The other highlight of this museum is the number of outdoor static displays.  Helicopters, jets, prop planes...it is all here and you can get up close and personal with all of them.  My personal highlight aside from the B-17 was actually getting close enough to walk under...and touch, the SR-71 on display here.  Be sure to leave yourself at least 4 hours to see it all.  There is a reason they sell a 2 day admission for $20...there is just so much to see, touch, and experience.  It is difficult to see it all in one visit.  Also, make sure to schedule your visit during the week, as Monday through Friday there are Boneyard tours available for an extra $7.  We visited on a Saturday so we couldn't take advantage of this, but it looks amazing as well.  If you like aviation, especially WWII history, make this museum a must see visit on your itinerary.  You won't be disappointed.|\n",

We had beer and wine, and my wife also had a lemon drop.  The bar staff here rocks...they made great cocktails with excellent flavor.  We also learned that some of the drinks were 50% off if you were waiting for a table, what an unexpected bonus!  I had the shrimp scampi with angel hair our first night, and the steak medallions with gorgonzola cheese and linguine.  Both dishes were out of this world, great flavor and just the right amount of pasta.  We had tiramisu the first night and skipped dessert the second night, just too full of the great food.

We had a Chicken Caesar salad, a Reuben sandwich, side of fries, Mountain Dew, and a Bud Light for $27.  I have read the other reviews complaining about the high prices here, but it is competitive with other area restaurants and the convenience of eating onsite trumps the other options.  Our food was prepared to order, and served hot and fresh.  My french fries were a very healthy portion that we actually couldn't finish.  You order your hot food directly from the line cook and he gives you a voucher which you hand to the cashier.  Our food was ready in about 7 minutes and delivered to our table.  Be sure to check out the wall display of all of the service pieces from airlines of the 60's/70's/80's.  We spent a good 15 minutes reminiscing about the days of past when you could actually eat a mediocre meal at 30,000 feet with a complimentary swizzle stick.  Kids who don't know what that is NEED to visit this exhibit inside the Flight Grill.  Well worth the 5 star rating I am throwing here, thanks for the great food and service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

We rode our mountain bikes here after finding the trail system listed on MTB Project...and boy, are we glad we did.  We rode the Bunny Loop, Snake Dance, and Bunny's Revenge the first day, about a 7 mile set of loop trails that were very well marked, and obviously lots of care and maintenance on these desert trails.  We rode two weekdays and a Friday here, and the trails were only really busy on Friday mid-morning.  Plentiful and easily accessed parking was available.  What impressed us the most was the many cool trail signs, and desert knick nacks that were used as either memorials, or trail markers.  The trails were easy to find and route each time we rode.  The second day we entered the trail system from the north and rode Lone Cactus Loop, which was more of a blue trail with some fun ups and downs.  Definitely a better workout on that trail than the Bunny Loop, but the lower loops would be a great warm up to link with the northern trails.  Again, Lone Cactus Loop was very well marked and maintained.  There was one section that was especially challenging and it was aptly signed \"\"Half Pipe.\"\"  I loved it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

This place is a girls ultimate nightmare if you want to somewhat keep your length. I tried to be reasonable and give it a few days to get used to it, however NOBODY should ever feel this way after getting their hair done. If you're looking for a professional ladies hair cut, go elsewhere. I'm now investing out of pocket to get extensions.

The popcorn is great however the food is not so good and kinda expensive. But worst of all is the service once you get your order it takes forever to get your server to come back for a refill on your drink or perhaps more catsup or even refill on your popcorn which is supposed to be all you can eat. Then there right on about getting your bill (of course) just about ruined the comfortable chairs and great sound system that for me anyway but YES I'll go back but we're not gonna eat there and thinking of bringing water bottles In my wife's purse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

The highlight of our stay was the morning breakfasts, and the staff.  Excellent customer service, friendly, and very efficient.  Our room was clean, and kept that way by the great housekeeping staff.  The heat and air conditioning worked flawlessly, and we really liked the amenities in our room.  The room was spacious, we used the fridge to store drinks, but found ourselves frequenting the complimentary soda during the evening hours, a very nice touch.  There is also a food kiosk available 7/24 at the front desk, another nice feature.  There was a big group of team volleyball players that kept the place hopping on Friday and Saturday.  The staff kept up, keeping things stocked and clean during the busy hours.  There was a bit of noise from all the kids, doors slamming, running in the halls, and general loud voices.  To be expected with the weekend crowds.  All was quiet after 10pm, thankfully.  Our TV worked great, we really liked the convenient outlets in the room.  Great for charging all of our electronics.  I know this hotel is on the lower end of the luxury spectrum, but we had a really good experience here.  One thing we felt could make the hallways quieter was some sound absorbing wall coverings, maybe some canvas pictures etc.  That was our only critique, and really it was a very small one.                                                                                                               |\n",

The admission was $31 for two adults, and worth the three hours we spent checking out all the cool displays.  I can't accurately convey all of the cool aviation history here, suffice to say it is vast.  If you go, don't miss the B17 hangar with all of the 570th Bombing Group memorabilia.  It is an incredible insight into the odds that were faced by the flight crews of these beautiful flying machines.  We have been to the Air and Space Museum in San Diego, as well as several other aviation displays and air shows.  The other highlight of this museum is the number of outdoor static displays.  Helicopters, jets, prop planes...it is all here and you can get up close and personal with all of them.  My personal highlight aside from the B-17 was actually getting close enough to walk under...and touch, the SR-71 on display here.  Be sure to leave yourself at least 4 hours to see it all.  There is a reason they sell a 2 day admission for $20...there is just so much to see, touch, and experience.  It is difficult to see it all in one visit.  Also, make sure to schedule your visit during the week, as Monday through Friday there are Boneyard tours available for an extra $7.  We visited on a Saturday so we couldn't take advantage of this, but it looks amazing as well.  If you like aviation, especially WWII history, make this museum a must see visit on your itinerary.  You won't be disappointed.|\n",

We had beer and wine, and my wife also had a lemon drop.  The bar staff here rocks...they made great cocktails with excellent flavor.  We also learned that some of the drinks were 50% off if you were waiting for a table, what an unexpected bonus!  I had the shrimp scampi with angel hair our first night, and the steak medallions with gorgonzola cheese and linguine.  Both dishes were out of this world, great flavor and just the right amount of pasta.  We had tiramisu the first night and skipped dessert the second night, just too full of the great food.

We had a Chicken Caesar salad, a Reuben sandwich, side of fries, Mountain Dew, and a Bud Light for $27.  I have read the other reviews complaining about the high prices here, but it is competitive with other area restaurants and the convenience of eating onsite trumps the other options.  Our food was prepared to order, and served hot and fresh.  My french fries were a very healthy portion that we actually couldn't finish.  You order your hot food directly from the line cook and he gives you a voucher which you hand to the cashier.  Our food was ready in about 7 minutes and delivered to our table.  Be sure to check out the wall display of all of the service pieces from airlines of the 60's/70's/80's.  We spent a good 15 minutes reminiscing about the days of past when you could actually eat a mediocre meal at 30,000 feet with a complimentary swizzle stick.  Kids who don't know what that is NEED to visit this exhibit inside the Flight Grill.  Well worth the 5 star rating I am throwing here, thanks for the great food and service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

We rode our mountain bikes here after finding the trail system listed on MTB Project...and boy, are we glad we did.  We rode the Bunny Loop, Snake Dance, and Bunny's Revenge the first day, about a 7 mile set of loop trails that were very well marked, and obviously lots of care and maintenance on these desert trails.  We rode two weekdays and a Friday here, and the trails were only really busy on Friday mid-morning.  Plentiful and easily accessed parking was available.  What impressed us the most was the many cool trail signs, and desert knick nacks that were used as either memorials, or trail markers.  The trails were easy to find and route each time we rode.  The second day we entered the trail system from the north and rode Lone Cactus Loop, which was more of a blue trail with some fun ups and downs.  Definitely a better workout on that trail than the Bunny Loop, but the lower loops would be a great warm up to link with the northern trails.  Again, Lone Cactus Loop was very well marked and maintained.  There was one section that was especially challenging and it was aptly signed \"\"Half Pipe.\"\"  I loved it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

This location was no exception, and my wife and I stopped by to have some fresh deli after a mountain bike ride.  She ordered a #7 and I had the #13 Mike's Way.  Both were made fresh and to order, and the staff even delivered our sandwiches to our table...boom, 5 Star customer service there!!  We had the combos, and our food, chips, and drinks were perfect!!
